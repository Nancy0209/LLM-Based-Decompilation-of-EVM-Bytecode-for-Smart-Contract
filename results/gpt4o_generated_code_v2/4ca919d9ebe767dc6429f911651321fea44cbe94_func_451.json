These were removed.\n\n3. **Added Constructor**:\n   - A constructor was added to initialize the `owner` variable to the address that deploys the contract.\n\n4. **Added `onlyOwner` Modifier**:\n   - A modifier was added to simplify the ownership check and make the code reusable.\n\n5. **Event Logging**:\n   - The `OwnershipTransferred` event was retained and used to log ownership changes.\n\n6. **Syntax Fixes**:\n   - Fixed the incorrect assignment of `owner` to `uint96(owner)` and replaced it with `address(0)` to properly renounce ownership.\n\n7. **Readability**:\n   - The code is now clean, readable, and adheres to Solidity best practices.\n\nThis refactored code is ready for deployment and complies with modern Solidity standards.",
