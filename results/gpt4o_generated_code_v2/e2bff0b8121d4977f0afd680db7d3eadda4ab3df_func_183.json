The getter function `owner()` provides access to the `_owner` variable.\n\n2. **Removed Unnecessary Variables**: The decompiled code contained unused variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`, `var_d`) that were irrelevant to the functionality. These have been removed.\n\n3. **Added Constructor**: A constructor initializes the contract with the deployer as the owner and emits the `OwnershipTransferred` event.\n\n4. **Added `onlyOwner` Modifier**: The `onlyOwner` modifier simplifies the ownership check and makes the code reusable.\n\n5. **Event Logging**: The `OwnershipTransferred` event is emitted when ownership is renounced, providing transparency.\n\n6. **Modern Solidity Version**: The code uses `pragma solidity ^0.8.0`, which includes built-in overflow checks and other improvements.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and adheres to Solidity best practices.",
