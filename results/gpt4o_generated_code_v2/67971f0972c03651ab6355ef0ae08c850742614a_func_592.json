These were removed to simplify the function.\n3. **Added Context**: Included comments and a clear explanation of the function's purpose.\n4. **Modern Solidity Practices**: Used `pragma solidity ^0.8.0` to ensure compatibility with modern Solidity versions and avoid issues like integer overflows.\n5. **Standardized Functionality**: The function now adheres to the standard ERC-20 `allowance` function implementation.",
