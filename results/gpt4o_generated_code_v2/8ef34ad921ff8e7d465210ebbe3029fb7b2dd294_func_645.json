These were removed to simplify the function.\n3. **Added Constructor**: A constructor was added to initialize the owner of the contract when deployed.\n4. **Added `onlyOwner` Modifier**: A modifier was introduced to enforce ownership checks, improving readability and reusability.\n5. **Event Declaration**: The `OwnershipTransferred` event was properly declared and used to log ownership changes.\n6. **Modern Solidity Version**: The code uses Solidity `^0.8.0`, which includes built-in overflow checks, removing the need for manual checks.\n7. **Readability**: The code is now clean, readable, and adheres to Solidity best practices.\n\nThis refactored code is ready for deployment and compilation.",
