This was inferred as a likely missing feature based on the context.\n5. **Modern Solidity Version**: Updated the code to use Solidity 0.8.0+ for better safety and readability.\n6. **Comments and Documentation**: Added comments and NatSpec documentation for clarity.\n\nThis code is now clean, readable, and compilable.",
