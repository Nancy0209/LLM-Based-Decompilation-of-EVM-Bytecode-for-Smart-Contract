These were removed to simplify the logic.\n\n3. **Allowance Mapping**: Added a `mapping` to store allowances, which is standard for ERC20 tokens.\n\n4. **Approval Event**: Added the `Approval` event to follow the ERC20 standard.\n\n5. **Zero Address Check**: Added a `require` statement to ensure the `spender` address is not the zero address.\n\n6. **Allowance Getter**: Included a `allowance` function to retrieve the current allowance for a spender, which is part of the ERC20 standard.\n\n7. **Modern Solidity Version**: Updated the code to use Solidity `^0.8.0`, which includes built-in overflow checks, making the code safer.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and adheres to the ERC20 token standard.",
