These were removed, and the logic was simplified to use clear and meaningful names.\n2. **Added Context**: The `Ownable` contract structure was added to provide context for the `renounceOwnership` function.\n3. **Removed Redundant Code**: The decompiled code contained unnecessary operations and variables. These were removed to simplify the function.\n4. **Added `onlyOwner` Modifier**: A modifier was added to ensure that only the current owner can call the `renounceOwnership` function.\n5. **Event Emission**: The `OwnershipTransferred` event is emitted when ownership is renounced, providing transparency and traceability.\n6. **Best Practices**: The code adheres to Solidity best practices, including using `address(0)` to represent the absence of an owner and using the latest Solidity version (`^0.8.0`) to avoid issues like integer overflow.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and ready for deployment.",
