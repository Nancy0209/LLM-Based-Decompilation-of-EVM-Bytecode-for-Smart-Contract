These were removed to simplify the logic.\n3. **Fixed Syntax**: Ensured proper Solidity syntax and structure.\n4. **Added Comments**: Included comments to explain the purpose of the code for better readability.\n5. **Modern Solidity Version**: Used `pragma solidity ^0.8.0` for better safety features like overflow checks.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and ready for compilation.",
