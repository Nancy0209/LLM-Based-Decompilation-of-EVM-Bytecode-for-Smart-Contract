The logic now directly compares the input address with the stored `owner` address.\n4. **Added a Getter Function**: Created a `getOwner` function to retrieve the owner's address, as it was referenced in the decompiled code.\n5. **Improved Readability**: Used clear and descriptive variable names (`owner`, `account`) and added a require statement to validate the input address.\n6. **Removed Unnecessary Code**: Eliminated redundant operations like `address(getOwner / 0x01)` and unnecessary negations.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and adheres to Solidity best practices.",
