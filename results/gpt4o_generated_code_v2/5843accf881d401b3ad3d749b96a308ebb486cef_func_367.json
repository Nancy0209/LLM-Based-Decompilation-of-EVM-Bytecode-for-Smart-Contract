The getter function `owner()` provides public access to the `_owner` variable.\n2. **Removed Unnecessary Variables**: The decompiled code contained unused variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`, `var_d`) that were irrelevant to the functionality. These were removed for clarity.\n3. **Added Constructor**: A constructor initializes the contract with the deployer as the owner and emits the `OwnershipTransferred` event.\n4. **Added `onlyOwner` Modifier**: The `onlyOwner` modifier simplifies the ownership check and makes the code reusable.\n5. **Event Emission**: The `OwnershipTransferred` event is emitted when ownership is renounced, providing transparency.\n6. **Updated Syntax**: The code now uses modern Solidity syntax (`pragma solidity ^0.8.0`) and avoids deprecated constructs.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, functional, and adheres to Solidity best practices.",
