These were removed to simplify the function.\n3. **Error Messages**: Clear and concise error messages were added to the `require` statements.\n4. **Event Emission**: The `OwnershipTransferred` event is emitted only once, and the logic is simplified.\n5. **Access Control**: The `onlyOwner` modifier is used to enforce that only the current owner can call the `transferOwnership` function.\n6. **Constructor**: A constructor is added to initialize the contract owner when the contract is deployed.\n7. **Compatibility**: The code is written in Solidity 0.8.0, which includes built-in overflow checks, making the code safer.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and adheres to Solidity best practices.",
