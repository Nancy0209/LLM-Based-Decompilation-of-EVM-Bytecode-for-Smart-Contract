Introduced the `onlyOwner` modifier for access control.\n3. **Event**: Added an `AirDropSet` event to log when an airdrop is set.\n4. **Require Statements**: Simplified and clarified the `require` statements to ensure proper validation of inputs.\n5. **Overflow Check**: Added a check to prevent overflow when updating the recipient's balance.\n6. **Mapping Name**: Renamed `storage_map_i` to `airDropBalances` for clarity.\n7. **General Cleanup**: Removed unnecessary variables and unused code, and improved variable naming for better readability.\n\nThis code is now clean, readable, and adheres to Solidity best practices.",
