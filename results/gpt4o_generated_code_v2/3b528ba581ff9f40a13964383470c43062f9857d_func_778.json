Instead, I added a check to ensure the address is not the zero address.\n3. **Simplified Logic**: Removed unused variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`) and directly returned the balance from the mapping.\n4. **Added Comments**: Included comments to explain the purpose of the function and the mapping.\n5. **Added SPDX License Identifier**: Added the SPDX license identifier for compliance with Solidity best practices.\n6. **Updated Solidity Version**: Used `pragma solidity ^0.8.0` to ensure compatibility with modern Solidity versions and avoid issues like integer overflow.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and adheres to Solidity best practices.",
