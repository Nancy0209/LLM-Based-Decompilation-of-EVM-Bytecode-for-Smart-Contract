It seemed to be attempting to retrieve a token symbol from storage. This was simplified to a straightforward implementation where the symbol is stored as a string in a private variable.\n\n2. **Improved Variable Names**: The original code used cryptic variable names like `var_a`, `var_b`, etc. These were removed entirely in favor of a clean and readable implementation.\n\n3. **Removed Redundant Code**: The decompiled code contained unnecessary calculations and checks that were not meaningful. These were removed to focus on the core functionality.\n\n4. **Modern Solidity Practices**: The code was updated to use Solidity 0.8.0, which includes built-in overflow checks, making the code safer and more robust.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and functional, adhering to Solidity best practices.",
