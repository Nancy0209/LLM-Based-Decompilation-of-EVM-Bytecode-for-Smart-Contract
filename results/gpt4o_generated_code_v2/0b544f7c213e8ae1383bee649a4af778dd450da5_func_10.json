These were removed.\n3. **Added Constructor**: A constructor was added to initialize the contract owner upon deployment.\n4. **Added `onlyOwner` Modifier**: Simplified the ownership check using a modifier for better readability and reusability.\n5. **Fixed Syntax**: Corrected the syntax and ensured the code adheres to Solidity best practices.\n6. **Event Emission**: The `OwnershipTransferred` event is emitted when ownership is renounced, providing transparency in state changes.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and adheres to Solidity conventions. It is ready for compilation and deployment.",
