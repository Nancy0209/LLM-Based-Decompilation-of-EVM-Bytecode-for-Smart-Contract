Added a public `owner()` function to expose the owner address.\n2. **Removed Unnecessary Variables**: Removed unused variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`, `var_d`) as they were irrelevant to the functionality.\n3. **Added Constructor**: Added a constructor to initialize the contract owner when deployed.\n4. **Added Modifier**: Introduced the `onlyOwner` modifier to simplify ownership checks and improve code readability.\n5. **Fixed Syntax**: Corrected the syntax for assigning the owner and emitting the `OwnershipTransferred` event.\n6. **Event Logging**: Ensured the `OwnershipTransferred` event is emitted correctly when ownership is renounced.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and adheres to Solidity best practices.",
