These were removed for clarity.\n\n3. **Added Constructor**:\n   - A constructor was added to initialize the contract's owner as the deployer.\n\n4. **Added `onlyOwner` Modifier**:\n   - A modifier was added to simplify the ownership check and make the code reusable.\n\n5. **Event Emission**:\n   - The `OwnershipTransferred` event is emitted when ownership is renounced, providing transparency.\n\n6. **Modern Solidity Syntax**:\n   - Updated the code to use Solidity 0.8.x features, including the `pragma` directive and modern error handling (`require`).\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and adheres to Solidity best practices.",
