These have been removed.\n3. **Added Constructor**: A constructor was added to initialize the contract owner when the contract is deployed.\n4. **Added `onlyOwner` Modifier**: A modifier was added to enforce the ownership check, making the code cleaner and reusable.\n5. **Event Declaration**: The `OwnershipTransferred` event was declared to log ownership transfers.\n6. **Error Messages**: Clear and concise error messages were added for `require` statements.\n7. **Adherence to Solidity Style Guide**: The code follows Solidity's style guide for readability and maintainability.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and ready to be compiled.",
