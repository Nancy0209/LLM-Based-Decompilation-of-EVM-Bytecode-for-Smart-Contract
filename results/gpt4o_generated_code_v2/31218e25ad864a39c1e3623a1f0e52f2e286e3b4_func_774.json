These were removed.\n3. **Simplified Logic**: The original code used bitwise operations to modify `tradingEnabled`. This was replaced with a simple boolean flag (`true` or `false`) for clarity.\n4. **Added Constructor**: A constructor was added to initialize the `owner` and set `tradingEnabled` to `false` by default.\n5. **Added Modifier**: The `onlyOwner` modifier was introduced to simplify the ownership check and make the code reusable.\n6. **Clean Syntax**: The code was rewritten using modern Solidity syntax (`pragma solidity ^0.8.0`) for better safety and readability.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and fully functional.",
