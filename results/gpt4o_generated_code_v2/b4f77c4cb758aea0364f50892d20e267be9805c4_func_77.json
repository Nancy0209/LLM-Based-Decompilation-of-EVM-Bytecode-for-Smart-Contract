It seemed to involve unnecessary bitwise operations and redundant checks. These were removed to focus on the core functionality: returning the contract's name.\n\n2. **Added Constructor**: A constructor was added to initialize the contract's name when the contract is deployed.\n\n3. **Improved Readability**: Variable names and function names were made descriptive to improve readability and maintainability.\n\n4. **Removed Unused Variables**: Variables like `var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`, etc., were removed as they were unnecessary for the function's purpose.\n\n5. **Modern Solidity Practices**: The code was updated to use Solidity 0.8.0+ features, which include built-in overflow checks and other improvements.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and functional. It adheres to Solidity best practices and achieves the intended functionality of returning the contract's name.",
