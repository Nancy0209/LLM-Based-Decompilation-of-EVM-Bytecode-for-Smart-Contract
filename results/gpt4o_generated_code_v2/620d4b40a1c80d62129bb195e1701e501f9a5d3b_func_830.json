This was simplified to focus on meaningful functionality.\n3. **Added Comments**: Comments were added to explain the purpose of each part of the code.\n4. **Fixed Syntax**: The decompiled code had syntax issues and invalid operations. These were corrected to ensure the code compiles and runs correctly.\n5. **Assumptions**: Since the original code was unclear, assumptions were made to create a functional contract. For example, the `storageMap` mapping was added to simulate storage access.\n\nThis refactored contract is now clean, readable, and functional. If you have additional context or requirements, the code can be further refined.",
