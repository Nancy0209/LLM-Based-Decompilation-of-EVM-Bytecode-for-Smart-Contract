I retained the name and purpose.\n\n2. **Input Validation**:\n   - The original code had redundant checks for the input address. I simplified it to a single `require` statement to ensure the address is not the zero address.\n\n3. **Mapping for Balances**:\n   - The decompiled code referenced a `storage_map_b` variable, which I renamed to `_balances` for clarity and consistency with Solidity naming conventions.\n\n4. **Return Statement**:\n   - The function now directly returns the balance from the `_balances` mapping.\n\n5. **Removed Unnecessary Variables**:\n   - The decompiled code had unused variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`, etc.) and unnecessary operations. These were removed to simplify the function.\n\n6. **Error Message**:\n   - The error message in the `require` statement was retained but formatted properly for clarity.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and adheres to Solidity best practices.",
