These were removed to simplify the function.\n2. **Improved Naming**: Variable names like `arg0`, `var_a`, `var_b`, etc., were replaced with meaningful names like `account` and `balances` to improve readability.\n3. **Fixed Syntax**: The decompiled code had syntax issues and unused operations. These were corrected or removed.\n4. **Added Comments**: Comments were added to explain the purpose of the function and the mapping.\n5. **Modern Solidity Practices**: The code uses `pragma solidity ^0.8.0` to ensure compatibility with modern Solidity versions and avoid issues like integer overflows.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and adheres to Solidity best practices.",
