These were removed for clarity.\n\n3. **Ownership Logic**:\n   - The `renounceOwnership` function now directly sets the `_owner` to `address(0)` after emitting the `OwnershipTransferred` event.\n\n4. **Event Declaration**:\n   - Added the `OwnershipTransferred` event to log ownership changes.\n\n5. **Constructor**:\n   - Added a constructor to initialize the `_owner` to the contract deployer.\n\n6. **Access Control**:\n   - Introduced the `onlyOwner` modifier to enforce that only the current owner can call certain functions.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and adheres to Solidity best practices.",
