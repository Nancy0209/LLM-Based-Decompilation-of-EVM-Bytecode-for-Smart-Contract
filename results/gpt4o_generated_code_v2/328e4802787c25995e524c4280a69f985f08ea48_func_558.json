These were removed as they served no purpose.\n\n3. **Added Constructor**:\n   - A constructor was added to initialize the contract's owner to the deployer of the contract.\n\n4. **Added `onlyOwner` Modifier**:\n   - The `onlyOwner` modifier simplifies the ownership check and makes the code reusable.\n\n5. **Event Emission**:\n   - The `OwnershipTransferred` event is emitted when ownership is renounced, providing transparency.\n\n6. **Syntax and Readability**:\n   - The code was refactored to follow Solidity's best practices for readability and maintainability.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and ready for deployment.",
