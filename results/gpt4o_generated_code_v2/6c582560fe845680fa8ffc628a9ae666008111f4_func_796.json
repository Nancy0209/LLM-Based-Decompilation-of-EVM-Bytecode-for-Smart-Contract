Instead, added a check to ensure the address is not the zero address.\n3. **Simplified logic**: Directly returned the balance from the mapping without unnecessary intermediate variables.\n4. **Added comments**: Included comments to explain the purpose of the mapping and the function.\n5. **Updated syntax**: Used modern Solidity conventions, including the latest version pragma (`^0.8.0`) and SPDX license identifier.",
