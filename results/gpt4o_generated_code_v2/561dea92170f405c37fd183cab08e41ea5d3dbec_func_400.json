The original code had unnecessary operations like double negations and redundant assignments.\n3. **Added Validation**: Added a check to ensure the input address is not the zero address (`address(0)`).\n4. **Modern Solidity Practices**: Used `pragma solidity ^0.8.0` for modern Solidity features and safety checks (e.g., overflow protection).\n5. **Commenting**: Added comments to explain the purpose of the mapping and the function.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and adheres to best practices in Solidity development.",
