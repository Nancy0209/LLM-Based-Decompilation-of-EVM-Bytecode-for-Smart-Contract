For example, `owner` is now `_owner` to follow Solidity's private variable naming convention.\n2. **Removed Redundant Code**: The decompiled code contained unnecessary variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`, `var_d`) and operations. These were removed as they are irrelevant to the functionality.\n3. **Added Constructor**: A constructor was added to initialize the contract's owner when deployed.\n4. **Added `onlyOwner` Modifier**: A modifier was introduced to simplify the ownership check and make the code reusable.\n5. **Event Logging**: The `OwnershipTransferred` event is emitted when ownership is renounced, providing transparency.\n6. **Modern Solidity Version**: The code uses `pragma solidity ^0.8.0` to leverage the latest features and avoid issues like integer overflows.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and adheres to Solidity best practices.",
