These were removed, and the logic was simplified to use clear and meaningful names.\n2. **Ownership Logic**: The ownership logic was rewritten using standard practices for an `Ownable` contract.\n3. **Event Emission**: The `OwnershipTransferred` event is emitted when ownership is renounced, following standard conventions.\n4. **Modifiers**: Added the `onlyOwner` modifier to ensure only the owner can renounce ownership.\n5. **Removed Redundant Code**: The decompiled code contained unnecessary calculations and variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, etc.) that were removed for clarity.\n6. **Modern Solidity Version**: Updated the code to use Solidity `^0.8.0`, which includes built-in overflow checks, removing the need for manual checks.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and ready for deployment.",
