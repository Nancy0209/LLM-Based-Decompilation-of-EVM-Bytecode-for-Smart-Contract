Removed unnecessary variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`, etc.) as they were redundant and confusing.\n2. **Simplified Logic**: The original code had unnecessary operations and obfuscated logic. The refactored code directly sets `swapEnabled` to `true` when the owner calls the `enableTrading` function.\n3. **Added `onlyOwner` Modifier**: Encapsulated the ownership check into a reusable modifier for better readability and maintainability.\n4. **Removed Redundant Code**: The original code contained unused variables and operations that did not contribute to the functionality. These were removed to simplify the contract.\n5. **Added Constructor**: The constructor initializes the `owner` variable to the address that deploys the contract and sets `swapEnabled` to `false` by default.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and adheres to Solidity best practices.",
