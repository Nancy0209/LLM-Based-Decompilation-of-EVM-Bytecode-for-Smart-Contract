These were removed.\n\n3. **Added `onlyOwner` Modifier**:\n   - Encapsulated the ownership check (`require(msg.sender == owner, ...)`) into a reusable `onlyOwner` modifier for cleaner code.\n\n4. **Simplified Logic**:\n   - The `burnMode` update logic was simplified to directly use the bitwise OR operation.\n\n5. **Added Constructor**:\n   - Added a constructor to initialize the `owner` variable to the address that deploys the contract.\n\n6. **Updated Solidity Version**:\n   - Used `pragma solidity ^0.8.0` to leverage modern Solidity features like built-in overflow checks.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and ready for deployment.",
