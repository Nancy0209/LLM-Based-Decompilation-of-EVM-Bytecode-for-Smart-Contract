Added a constructor to initialize the `owner` variable.\n2. **Removed Unnecessary Variables**: The decompiled code included unused variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`, `var_d`) that served no purpose. These were removed for clarity.\n3. **Added Comments**: Added comments to explain the purpose of the code and placeholders for future functionality.\n4. **Added `getOwner` Function**: Included a helper function to retrieve the owner's address for better usability.\n5. **Modern Solidity Version**: Updated the code to use Solidity version `^0.8.0` to avoid issues like integer overflows and to use the latest language features.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and ready for further development.",
