These were replaced with meaningful names and removed where unnecessary.\n2. **Ownership Logic**: The ownership logic was simplified using a private `_owner` variable and a `onlyOwner` modifier for access control.\n3. **Event Emission**: The `OwnershipTransferred` event is emitted when ownership is renounced, providing transparency.\n4. **Removed Redundant Code**: Unnecessary calculations and variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, etc.) were removed as they were irrelevant to the functionality.\n5. **Modern Solidity Version**: The code uses `pragma solidity ^0.8.0` to leverage modern features like built-in overflow checks.\n6. **Readability**: The code is structured and commented for clarity, making it easier to understand and maintain.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, functional, and adheres to Solidity best practices.",
