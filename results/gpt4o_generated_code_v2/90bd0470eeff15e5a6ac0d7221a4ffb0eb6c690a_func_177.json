It likely represented a simple function to return a token's symbol. The rewritten code directly implements this functionality.\n2. **Added Constructor**: A constructor was added to initialize the `_symbol` variable, which is a common practice for ERC-20 tokens or similar contracts.\n3. **Removed Unnecessary Variables**: The decompiled code had many unused or redundant variables. These were removed to make the code clean and readable.\n4. **Modern Solidity Version**: The code uses Solidity version `^0.8.0`, which includes built-in overflow checks, making the code safer and simpler.\n5. **Readability**: The function and variable names were improved to follow Solidity's naming conventions and make the code self-explanatory.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and functional. It assumes the contract's purpose is to store and return a token's symbol. If the original contract had additional functionality, it would need to be incorporated separately.",
