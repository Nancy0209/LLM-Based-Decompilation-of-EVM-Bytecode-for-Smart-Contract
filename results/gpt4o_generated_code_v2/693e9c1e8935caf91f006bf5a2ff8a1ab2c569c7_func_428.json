These were removed for clarity.\n\n3. **Added Access Control**:\n   - Introduced a `modifier` called `onlyOwner` to enforce that only the contract owner can call the `openTrading` function.\n\n4. **Simplified Logic**:\n   - Replaced the bitwise operation on `tradingOpen` with a simple boolean assignment (`tradingOpen = true`).\n\n5. **Added Constructor**:\n   - The constructor initializes the `owner` variable to the address that deploys the contract.\n\n6. **Added Getter for Owner**:\n   - Provided a `getOwner` function to allow external access to the owner's address.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and adheres to Solidity best practices.",
