These were artifacts of the decompilation process and are not needed.\n\n3. **Added Constructor**:\n   - Added a constructor to initialize the contract's owner to the deployer of the contract.\n\n4. **Added `onlyOwner` Modifier**:\n   - Created a reusable `onlyOwner` modifier to simplify the ownership check and improve readability.\n\n5. **Fixed Ownership Transfer Logic**:\n   - Correctly set `_owner` to `address(0)` when ownership is renounced, ensuring the contract has no owner.\n\n6. **Event Emission**:\n   - Retained the `OwnershipTransferred` event to log ownership changes, which is a best practice for transparency.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and adheres to Solidity best practices. It is also fully functional and ready for deployment.",
