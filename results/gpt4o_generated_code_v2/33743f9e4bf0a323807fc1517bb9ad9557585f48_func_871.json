A public getter function `owner()` is added for external access.\n2. **Removed Unnecessary Variables**: The decompiled code contained unused variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`, `var_d`) that were irrelevant to the function's logic. These were removed for clarity.\n3. **Added Constructor**: A constructor initializes the contract with the deployer as the owner and emits the `OwnershipTransferred` event.\n4. **Added `onlyOwner` Modifier**: The `onlyOwner` modifier simplifies the ownership check and makes the code reusable for other functions.\n5. **Event Emission**: The `OwnershipTransferred` event is emitted when ownership is renounced, providing transparency.\n6. **Updated Solidity Version**: The code uses `pragma solidity ^0.8.0` to leverage modern Solidity features like built-in overflow checks and improved error handling.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and adheres to Solidity best practices.",
