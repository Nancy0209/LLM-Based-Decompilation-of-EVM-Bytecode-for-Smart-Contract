These were removed.\n3. **Added Constructor**: Added a constructor to initialize the `owner` variable with the address of the contract deployer.\n4. **Added `onlyOwner` Modifier**: Encapsulated the ownership check logic into a reusable `onlyOwner` modifier for better readability and maintainability.\n5. **Event for State Changes**: Added an event `LimitsUpdated` to log changes to the `limits` variable, which is a good practice for transparency.\n6. **Modern Solidity Version**: Used `pragma solidity ^0.8.0` to leverage the latest features and avoid issues like integer overflow/underflow.\n7. **Removed Hardcoded Error Messages**: Used a clean and readable error message for the ownership check.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and adheres to Solidity best practices.",
