These were removed to simplify the logic.\n3. **Added Constructor**: A constructor was added to initialize the contract owner when the contract is deployed.\n4. **Added `onlyOwner` Modifier**: A modifier was introduced to enforce the ownership check, making the code cleaner and reusable.\n5. **Event Declaration**: The `OwnershipTransferred` event was explicitly declared and used to log ownership changes.\n6. **Zero Address Check**: A proper check ensures that the new owner is not the zero address, preventing accidental loss of ownership.\n7. **Modern Solidity Version**: The code uses Solidity 0.8.0, which includes built-in overflow checks, making the code safer.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and adheres to Solidity best practices.",
