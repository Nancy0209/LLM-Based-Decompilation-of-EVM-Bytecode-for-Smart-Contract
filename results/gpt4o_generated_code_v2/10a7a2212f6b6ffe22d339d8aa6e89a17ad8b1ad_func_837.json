The `var_a`, `var_b`, and `var_c` variables were also redundant and removed.\n3. **Added Comments**: Added comments to explain the purpose of the function and the mapping.\n4. **Fixed Syntax**: Updated the code to follow modern Solidity best practices, including using `pragma solidity ^0.8.0` to avoid issues like integer overflow/underflow.\n5. **Validation**: Added a check to ensure the `account` address is not the zero address (`address(0)`).\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and adheres to Solidity best practices.",
