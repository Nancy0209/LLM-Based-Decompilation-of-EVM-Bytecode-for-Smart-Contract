These were removed to simplify the function.\n3. **Added Comments**: Added comments to explain the purpose of the function and the mapping.\n4. **Modern Solidity Version**: Updated the code to use Solidity version `^0.8.0` to avoid issues like integer overflows and to follow modern best practices.\n5. **Added SPDX License Identifier**: Included the SPDX license identifier for compliance with Solidity conventions.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and ready to compile.",
