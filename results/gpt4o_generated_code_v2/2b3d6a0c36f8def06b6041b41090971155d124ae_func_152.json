These were removed.\n\n3. **Added Constructor**:\n   - A constructor was added to initialize the `_owner` variable to the address that deploys the contract.\n\n4. **Added `onlyOwner` Modifier**:\n   - The `onlyOwner` modifier simplifies the ownership check and makes the code reusable for other owner-restricted functions.\n\n5. **Fixed Ownership Transfer Logic**:\n   - The `renounceOwnership` function now sets `_owner` to `address(0)` to indicate that ownership has been renounced.\n\n6. **Event Emission**:\n   - The `OwnershipTransferred` event is emitted with the correct parameters to log the ownership change.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and adheres to Solidity best practices.",
