These were removed.\n3. **Added Comments**: Comments were added to explain the purpose of the function and its requirements.\n4. **Event Declaration**: The `Approval` event was explicitly declared to match the ERC20 standard.\n5. **Allowance Mapping**: A mapping `_allowances` was added to store the allowances, as this is a standard part of ERC20 contracts.\n6. **Zero Address Check**: The `require` statements were simplified to ensure the `spender` is not the zero address.\n7. **Return Value**: The function now explicitly returns `true` to indicate success, as per the ERC20 standard.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and adheres to the ERC20 token standard.",
