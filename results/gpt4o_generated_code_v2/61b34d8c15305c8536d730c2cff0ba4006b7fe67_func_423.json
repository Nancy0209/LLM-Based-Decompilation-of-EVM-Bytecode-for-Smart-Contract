These have been removed.\n3. **Added Constructor**: A constructor was added to initialize the contract's owner to the deployer.\n4. **Added `onlyOwner` Modifier**: A modifier was introduced to simplify the ownership check and make the code reusable.\n5. **Added `owner` Getter Function**: A public getter function for the owner was added to allow external contracts or users to query the current owner.\n6. **Fixed Ownership Logic**: The ownership transfer logic was corrected to properly set the owner to `address(0)` when renouncing ownership.\n7. **Event Emission**: The `OwnershipTransferred` event is emitted with the correct parameters.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and adheres to Solidity standards.",
