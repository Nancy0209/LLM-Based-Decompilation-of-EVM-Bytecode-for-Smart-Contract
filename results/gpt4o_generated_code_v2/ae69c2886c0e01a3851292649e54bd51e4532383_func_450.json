Instead, a check for `address(0)` (zero address) was added to ensure the input is valid.\n3. **Simplified Logic**: Removed unused variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`) and directly returned the balance from the mapping.\n4. **Added Comments**: Included comments to explain the purpose of the mapping and the function.\n5. **Modern Solidity Version**: Updated the code to use `pragma solidity ^0.8.0` for better safety features like built-in overflow checks.",
