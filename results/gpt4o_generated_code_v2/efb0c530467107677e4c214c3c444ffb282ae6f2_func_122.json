The decompiled code had unused variables and unclear logic, which were cleaned up.\n3. **Event Declaration**: Added a proper `LotteryEnded` event declaration to signal the end of the lottery.\n4. **State Variable**: Introduced `isLotteryRunning` as a boolean to track the lottery's status instead of using unclear data types like `uint248`.\n5. **Constructor**: Added a constructor to initialize the admin and set the lottery status to running.\n6. **Error Messages**: Improved error messages for `require` statements to make them more descriptive.\n7. **Modern Solidity Version**: Used `pragma solidity ^0.8.0` for better safety features like built-in overflow checks.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and ready for deployment.",
