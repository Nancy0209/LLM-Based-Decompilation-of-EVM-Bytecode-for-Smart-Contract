The decompiled code had unnecessary operations like double negations and redundant assignments.\n3. **Added Input Validation**: Added a `require` statement to ensure the input address is not the zero address.\n4. **Added Comments**: Included comments to explain the purpose of the contract and the function.\n5. **Updated Solidity Version**: Used `pragma solidity ^0.8.0` to ensure compatibility with modern Solidity features and to avoid issues like integer overflow.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and ready for compilation.",
