These were removed for clarity.\n\n3. **Added Constructor**:\n   - A constructor was added to initialize the contract's owner to the deployer.\n\n4. **Added `onlyOwner` Modifier**:\n   - Encapsulated the ownership check (`require(msg.sender == _owner, ...)`) into a reusable `onlyOwner` modifier.\n\n5. **Event Emission**:\n   - The `OwnershipTransferred` event is emitted when ownership is renounced, providing transparency.\n\n6. **Modern Solidity Version**:\n   - Updated the code to use Solidity 0.8.x, which includes built-in overflow checks and other improvements.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and adheres to Solidity best practices.",
