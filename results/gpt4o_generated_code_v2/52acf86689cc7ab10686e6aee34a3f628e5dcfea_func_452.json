These were simplified.\n\n3. **Added Comments**:\n   - Added comments to explain the purpose of the mapping and the function.\n\n4. **Fixed Syntax**:\n   - Removed unused variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`) and simplified the logic.\n\n5. **Added Input Validation**:\n   - Added a check to ensure the input address is not the zero address (`address(0)`).\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and adheres to Solidity best practices.",
