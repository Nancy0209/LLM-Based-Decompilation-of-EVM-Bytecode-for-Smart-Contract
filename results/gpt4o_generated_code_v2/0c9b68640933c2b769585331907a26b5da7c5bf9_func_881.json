Additionally, unused variables `var_a`, `var_b`, and `var_c` were removed.\n3. **Fixed Syntax**: Changed `storage_map_b` to `balances` to represent a mapping of balances, which is a common pattern in Solidity.\n4. **Added Comments**: Included comments to explain the purpose of the function and the mapping.\n5. **Added Validation**: Added a check to ensure the `account` is not the zero address (`address(0)`), which is a common best practice in Solidity.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and adheres to Solidity best practices.",
