These were removed.\n\n3. **Added Constructor**:\n   - A constructor was added to initialize the contract's owner when deployed.\n\n4. **Added `onlyOwner` Modifier**:\n   - Simplified the ownership check using a modifier for better readability and reusability.\n\n5. **Event Logging**:\n   - The `OwnershipTransferred` event is emitted when ownership is renounced, providing transparency.\n\n6. **Modern Solidity Version**:\n   - Updated the code to use Solidity 0.8.x, which includes built-in overflow checks and other improvements.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and adheres to Solidity best practices.",
