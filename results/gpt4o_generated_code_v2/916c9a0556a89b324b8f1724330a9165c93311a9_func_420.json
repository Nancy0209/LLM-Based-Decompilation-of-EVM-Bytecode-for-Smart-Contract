Variable names were removed as they were unnecessary in the decompiled code.\n\n2. **Removed Redundant Code**: The decompiled code contained unnecessary variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, etc.) and redundant operations. These were removed to simplify the logic.\n\n3. **Added Constructor**: Added a constructor to initialize the contract owner when the contract is deployed.\n\n4. **Added `onlyOwner` Modifier**: Introduced a modifier `onlyOwner` to enforce ownership checks, improving code readability and reusability.\n\n5. **Event Emission**: The `OwnershipTransferred` event is emitted before updating the owner, ensuring proper logging of ownership changes.\n\n6. **Error Messages**: Improved error messages to be more descriptive and user-friendly.\n\n7. **Modern Solidity Version**: Updated the code to use Solidity 0.8.0, which includes built-in overflow checks, making the code safer.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and adheres to Solidity best practices.",
