These were removed.\n3. **Fixed Syntax**: Corrected the syntax to make the code compilable and aligned with Solidity best practices.\n4. **Added Comments**: Included comments to explain the purpose of the function and the mapping.\n5. **Modern Solidity Version**: Used `pragma solidity ^0.8.0` to leverage the latest features and avoid issues like integer overflow.\n\nThis refactored code is clean, readable, and ready for use in a Solidity contract.",
