These were removed for clarity.\n3. **Added Modifier:** Introduced a `onlyOwner` modifier to simplify the ownership check and improve code reusability.\n4. **Validation:** Added a check to ensure the new owner address is not the zero address (`address(0)`), which is a common best practice.\n5. **Event Declaration:** Declared the `OwnershipTransferred` event properly with an indexed parameter for efficient filtering in logs.",
