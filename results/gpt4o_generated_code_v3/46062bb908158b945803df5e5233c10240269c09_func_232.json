Instead, I added a meaningful check to ensure the address is not the zero address.\n   - Removed the unused `var_b` and redundant `var_c` variables.\n\n2. **Meaningful Names:**\n   - Renamed `arg0` to `account` for clarity.\n   - Renamed `storage_map_h` to `balances` to reflect its purpose as a mapping of addresses to balances.\n\n3. **Simplified Logic:**\n   - Directly returned the balance from the `balances` mapping without unnecessary intermediate variables.",
