However, this check might be a placeholder for additional logic.\n- The variable `var_b` is set but not used, indicating it might be a remnant of a previous implementation or a placeholder for future logic.\n- The mapping `storage_map_b` is renamed to `balances` to clearly indicate its purpose of storing account balances.\n- The function returns the balance associated with the given address from the `balances` mapping.",
