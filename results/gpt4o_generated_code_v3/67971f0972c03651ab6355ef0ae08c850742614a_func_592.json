These were removed for clarity and efficiency.\n2. **Meaningful Names:** Variables and mappings were renamed to reflect their purpose in the context of an ERC20-like contract.\n3. **Standard ERC20 Pattern:** The refined code aligns with the standard ERC20 `allowance` function, which typically uses a mapping to store allowances indexed by a combination of owner and spender addresses.",
