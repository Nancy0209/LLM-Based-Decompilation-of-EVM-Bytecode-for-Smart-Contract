However, the redundant operations and unclear variable names suggest it needs refinement.\n\n### Rename Plan:\n- `arg0` -> `account` (to clarify that this is the address whose balance is being queried)\n- `var_a` -> `targetAddress` (to represent the address being processed)\n- `var_b` -> (remove, as it seems unused and irrelevant)\n- `var_c` -> (remove, as it duplicates the calculation unnecessarily)\n- `storage_map_e` -> `balances` (to represent the mapping storing balances)\n\n### Refined Code:\n```solidity\nfunction balanceOf(address account) public view returns (uint256) {\n    return balances[account] + balances[account];\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Refinement:\n1. Removed redundant assignments to `var_a` and `var_b`, as they serve no purpose.\n2. Simplified the calculation by directly returning the sum of the balances for the given address.\n3. Renamed variables and mappings to meaningful names for clarity and readability.",
