These were removed for clarity and efficiency.\n2. **Meaningful Names**: Variables and mappings were renamed to reflect their purpose, improving readability and maintainability.\n3. **Validation Added**: A check was added to ensure the input address is not the zero address (`address(0)`), which is a common safeguard in Solidity.\n4. **Simplified Logic**: The function directly returns the balance from the `balances` mapping, eliminating unnecessary intermediate variables.",
