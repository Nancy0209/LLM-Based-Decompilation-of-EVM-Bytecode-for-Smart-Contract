The original code contains unnecessary variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`) and redundant operations, which have been removed for clarity and efficiency.\n2. The mapping `storage_map_l` has been renamed to `allowances` to align with standard ERC-20 conventions.\n3. The refined code directly accesses the `allowances` mapping to return the allowance value, simplifying the logic and improving readability.",
