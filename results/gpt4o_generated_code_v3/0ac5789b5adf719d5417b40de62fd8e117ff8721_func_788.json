Removed the redundant `require` statement (`require(arg0 == (address(arg0)));`) since it serves no purpose. The `address(arg0)` conversion is unnecessary because `arg0` is already an address.\n2. Eliminated unused variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`) to simplify the code.\n3. Renamed `arg0` to `account` for clarity.\n4. Renamed `storage_map_b` to `balances` to better reflect its purpose as a mapping of addresses to balances.\n5. Simplified the function to directly return the balance from the `balances` mapping.",
