It also emits an event to log the update.\n\n### Rename Plan:\n- `arg0` -> `newDevelopmentWallet`\n- `owner` -> `contractOwner` (assuming this is a state variable for the contract owner)\n- `var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`, `var_d` -> Remove these variables as they seem to be artifacts of the decompilation process and are not used meaningfully in the code.\n- `developmentWallet` -> `developmentWallet` (unchanged, as it is already meaningful)\n- `developmentWalletUpdated` -> `DevelopmentWalletUpdated` (to follow Solidity naming conventions for events)\n\n### Refined Code:\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract ExampleContract {\n    address public contractOwner;\n    address public developmentWallet;\n\n    event DevelopmentWalletUpdated(address indexed newWallet, address indexed previousWallet);\n\n    modifier onlyOwner() {\n        require(msg.sender == contractOwner, \"Ownable: caller is not the owner\");\n        _;\n    }\n\n    constructor() {\n        contractOwner = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    function updateDevelopmentWallet(address newDevelopmentWallet) public onlyOwner {\n        require(newDevelopmentWallet != address(0), \"ERC20: Address 0\");\n\n        address previousWallet = developmentWallet;\n        developmentWallet = newDevelopmentWallet;\n\n        emit DevelopmentWalletUpdated(newDevelopmentWallet, previousWallet);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Refinements:\n1. **Removed unnecessary variables:** The `var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`, and `var_d` variables were artifacts of the decompilation process and served no purpose in the refined code.\n2. **Added `onlyOwner` modifier:** This simplifies the ownership check and makes the code cleaner.\n3. **Improved naming:** Renamed variables and events to follow Solidity's best practices for readability and clarity.\n4. **Added constructor:** Initialized the `contractOwner` to the deployer of the contract.\n5. **Event parameters:** Updated the event to include both the new and previous development wallet addresses for better traceability.",
