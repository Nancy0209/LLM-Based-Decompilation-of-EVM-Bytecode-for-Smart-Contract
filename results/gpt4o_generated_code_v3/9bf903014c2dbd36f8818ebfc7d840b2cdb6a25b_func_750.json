It also emits an event to notify about the wallet update.\n\n### Rename Plan:\n- `arg0` -> `newOperationsWallet`\n- `var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`, `var_d` -> Removed (these variables are unnecessary and seem to be artifacts of decompilation)\n- `operationsWallet` -> `operationsWallet` (no change, already meaningful)\n- `owner` -> `owner` (no change, already meaningful)\n\n### Refined Code:\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract OperationsWalletManager {\n    address public owner;\n    address public operationsWallet;\n\n    event OperationsWalletUpdated(address indexed newOperationsWallet, address indexed previousOperationsWallet);\n\n    modifier onlyOwner() {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Ownable: caller is not the owner\");\n        _;\n    }\n\n    constructor() {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    function updateOperationsWallet(address newOperationsWallet) public onlyOwner {\n        require(newOperationsWallet != address(0), \"Invalid address: newOperationsWallet cannot be the zero address\");\n        \n        emit OperationsWalletUpdated(newOperationsWallet, operationsWallet);\n        operationsWallet = newOperationsWallet;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Refinements:\n1. **Removed unnecessary variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`, `var_d`)**: These were artifacts of decompilation and not needed for the function's logic.\n2. **Added `onlyOwner` modifier**: Simplifies the ownership check and makes the code cleaner.\n3. **Added a constructor**: Initializes the `owner` variable to the contract deployer.\n4. **Added a zero address check**: Ensures the new wallet address is valid.\n5. **Renamed `arg0` to `newOperationsWallet`**: Provides clarity about the parameter's purpose.\n6. **Improved event name and parameters**: Made the event name more descriptive and included both the new and previous wallet addresses for better traceability.",
