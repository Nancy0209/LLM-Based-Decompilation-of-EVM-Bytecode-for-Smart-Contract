It also emits an event to log the ownership transfer.\n\n### Rename Plan:\n- `arg0` -> `newOwner`\n- `owner` -> `currentOwner`\n- `var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`, `var_d`, `var_e` -> Removed (these variables seem to be artifacts of the decompilation and are unnecessary in the refined code)\n\n### Refined Code:\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract Ownable {\n    address public currentOwner;\n\n    event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner);\n\n    constructor() {\n        currentOwner = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    modifier onlyOwner() {\n        require(msg.sender == currentOwner, \"Ownable: caller is not the owner\");\n        _;\n    }\n\n    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public onlyOwner {\n        require(newOwner != address(0), \"Ownable: new owner is the zero address\");\n        emit OwnershipTransferred(currentOwner, newOwner);\n        currentOwner = newOwner;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Refinements:\n1. **Removed unnecessary variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, etc.):** These variables were artifacts of the decompilation process and served no purpose in the refined code.\n2. **Added `onlyOwner` modifier:** This simplifies the ownership check and makes the code cleaner.\n3. **Renamed variables:** `arg0` was renamed to `newOwner` for clarity, and `owner` was renamed to `currentOwner` to better reflect its purpose.\n4. **Added constructor:** The constructor initializes the `currentOwner` to the address that deploys the contract.\n5. **Improved readability:** The refined code is clean, readable, and adheres to Solidity best practices.",
