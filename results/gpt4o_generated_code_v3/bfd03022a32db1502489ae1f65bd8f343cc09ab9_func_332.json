It also emits an event to signal the update.\n\n### Rename Plan:\n- `arg0` -> `newDevNodeAddress`\n- `_owner` -> `owner`\n- `var_a` -> `errorSelector`\n- `var_b` -> `errorOffset`\n- `var_c` -> `errorDataLength`\n- `var_d` -> `errorMessageLength`\n- `var_e` -> `errorMessage`\n- `DevSplinterOasisNode` -> `devNodeAddress`\n\n### Refined Code:\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract DevNodeManager {\n    address public owner;\n    address public devNodeAddress;\n\n    event DevNodeUpdated(address indexed newDevNodeAddress, address indexed previousDevNodeAddress);\n\n    modifier onlyOwner() {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Ownable: caller is not the owner\");\n        _;\n    }\n\n    constructor() {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    function updateDevNodeAddress(address newDevNodeAddress) public onlyOwner {\n        require(newDevNodeAddress != address(0), \"Invalid address: newDevNodeAddress cannot be zero\");\n\n        // Emit an event to signal the update\n        emit DevNodeUpdated(newDevNodeAddress, devNodeAddress);\n\n        // Update the devNodeAddress\n        devNodeAddress = newDevNodeAddress;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Refinements:\n1. **Simplified Logic:** Removed unnecessary calculations and variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, etc.) that were likely artifacts of the decompilation process and not meaningful in the original contract.\n2. **Improved Naming:** Renamed variables and function names to be more descriptive and meaningful.\n3. **Event Update:** Changed the event name to `DevNodeUpdated` for clarity and added indexed parameters for efficient filtering in logs.\n4. **Error Handling:** Added a check to ensure the new address is not the zero address.\n5. **Owner Check:** Used a `modifier` for the owner check to make the code cleaner and reusable.\n\nThis refined code is more readable, maintainable, and adheres to Solidity best practices.",
