However, the decompiled code contains redundant and unclear logic, which needs to be cleaned up and refined.\n\n### Rename Plan:\n- `arg0` -> `spender`\n- `arg1` -> `amount`\n- `var_a` -> `caller`\n- `var_b` -> (remove, as it is redundant)\n- `var_c` -> (remove, as it is redundant)\n- `var_d`, `var_e`, `var_f`, `var_g` -> (remove, as they are unused and irrelevant)\n- `storage_map_b` -> `allowances`\n\n### Refined Code:\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract ERC20 {\n    // Mapping to store allowances: owner => spender => amount\n    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) private allowances;\n\n    // Event to emit when an approval is made\n    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Approves `spender` to spend `amount` on behalf of the caller.\n     * @param spender The address which will spend the funds.\n     * @param amount The amount of tokens to be spent.\n     * @return success A boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.\n     */\n    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) public returns (bool success) {\n        require(spender != address(0), \"ERC20: approve to the zero address\");\n\n        // Update the allowance mapping\n        allowances[msg.sender][spender] = amount;\n\n        // Emit the Approval event\n        emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, amount);\n\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Returns the remaining number of tokens that `spender` is allowed to spend\n     * on behalf of `owner` through {approve}.
