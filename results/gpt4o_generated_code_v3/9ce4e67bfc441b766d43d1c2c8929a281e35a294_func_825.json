Removed the redundant `require` statement (`require(arg0 == (address(arg0)));`) since it serves no purpose. The `address(arg0)` cast is unnecessary because `arg0` is already an `address`.\n2. Removed unused variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`) that do not contribute to the function's logic.\n3. Simplified the function to directly return the balance from the `balances` mapping.\n4. Renamed `storage_map_h` to `balances` for clarity and consistency with common Solidity naming conventions.",
