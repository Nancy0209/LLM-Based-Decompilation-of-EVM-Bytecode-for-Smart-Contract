This was unnecessary, so I directly used `account` (renamed from `arg0`) in the refined code.\n2. **Removed Unused Variables:** `var_b` and `var_c` were unused or redundant, so they were removed.\n3. **Renamed Mapping:** `storage_map_b` was renamed to `balances` to better reflect its purpose as a mapping of addresses to balances.\n4. **Simplified Logic:** The `require` statement checking `arg0 == address(arg0)` was unnecessary because `arg0` is already an `address` type. This was removed for clarity and efficiency.",
