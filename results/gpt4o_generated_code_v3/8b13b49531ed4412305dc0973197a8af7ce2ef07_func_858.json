However, the code contains unnecessary variables and operations that need refinement.\n\n### Rename Plan:\n- `var_a` -> Remove (unused variable)\n- `var_b` -> Remove (unused variable)\n- `var_c` -> Remove (unused variable)\n- `var_d` -> Remove (unused variable)\n- `owner` -> `contractOwner`\n\n### Refined Code:\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract Ownable {\n    address private contractOwner;\n\n    event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner);\n\n    constructor() {\n        contractOwner = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    modifier onlyOwner() {\n        require(msg.sender == contractOwner, \"Ownable: caller is not the owner\");\n        _;\n    }\n\n    function renounceOwnership() public onlyOwner {\n        emit OwnershipTransferred(contractOwner, address(0));\n        contractOwner = address(0);\n    }\n\n    function owner() public view returns (address) {\n        return contractOwner;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Refinements:\n1. **Removed unnecessary variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`, `var_d`)**: These variables were not contributing to the functionality of the `renounceOwnership` function and were likely artifacts of decompilation.\n2. **Added `onlyOwner` modifier**: This simplifies the ownership check and makes the code cleaner.\n3. **Renamed `owner` to `contractOwner`**: This makes the variable name more descriptive and avoids potential confusion with the `owner()` function.\n4. **Added `owner()` function**: This is a standard getter function for the owner variable, providing clarity and usability.\n5. **Used `address(0)` for renouncing ownership**: This is the standard practice for indicating that ownership has been renounced.",
