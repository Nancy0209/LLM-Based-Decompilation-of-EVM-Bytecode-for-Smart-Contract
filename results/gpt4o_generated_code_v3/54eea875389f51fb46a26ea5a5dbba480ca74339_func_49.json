It also emits an event to notify about the update.\n\n### Rename Plan:\n- `arg0` -> `newLiquidityWallet` (the new address for the liquidity wallet)\n- `var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`, `var_d` -> Removed (these variables are artifacts of decompilation and are not needed in the refined code)\n- `liquidityWallet` -> Retained (already meaningful)\n- `owner` -> Retained (already meaningful)\n\n### Refined Code:\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract ExampleContract {\n    address public owner;\n    address public liquidityWallet;\n\n    event LiquidityWalletUpdated(address indexed previousWallet, address indexed newWallet);\n\n    modifier onlyOwner() {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Ownable: caller is not the owner\");\n        _;\n    }\n\n    constructor() {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    function updateLiquidityWallet(address newLiquidityWallet) public onlyOwner {\n        require(newLiquidityWallet != address(0), \"ERC20: Address 0\");\n\n        address previousWallet = liquidityWallet;\n        liquidityWallet = newLiquidityWallet;\n\n        emit LiquidityWalletUpdated(previousWallet, newLiquidityWallet);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Refinements:\n1. **Removed unnecessary variables:** The `var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`, and `var_d` were artifacts of the decompilation process and were not needed in the refined code.\n2. **Added `onlyOwner` modifier:** To simplify the ownership check, I added a reusable `onlyOwner` modifier.\n3. **Improved readability:** Renamed `arg0` to `newLiquidityWallet` for clarity and added an event `LiquidityWalletUpdated` to notify about changes.\n4. **Constructor:** Added a constructor to initialize the `owner` variable.\n5. **Validation:** Added a check to ensure the new liquidity wallet address is not the zero address.",
