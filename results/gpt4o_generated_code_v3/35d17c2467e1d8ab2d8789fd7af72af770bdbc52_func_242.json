The original code was overly convoluted and included unnecessary variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`) and operations (e.g., `keccak256` on `var_a`).\n2. The refined code simplifies the logic to directly return the allowance from the `allowances` mapping, which is the standard approach in ERC20 contracts.\n3. The mapping `allowances` is assumed to be a `mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256))` that stores the allowance values.",
