    "llm_full_output": "### Analysis:\nThe function appears to be a mechanism for the contract owner to remove or reset transaction and wallet limits, likely for a token contract. It ensures that only the owner can execute this operation.\n\n### Rename Plan:\n- `var_a` -> `errorSelector` (represents the selector for the error message)\n- `var_b` -> `errorOffset` (offset for the error message)\n- `var_c` -> `errorLength` (length of the error message)\n- `var_d` -> `errorMessage` (the actual error message string)\n- `maxWalletAmount` -> `maxWalletLimit` (represents the maximum wallet limit)\n- `maxTxAmount` -> `maxTransactionLimit` (represents the maximum transaction limit)\n\n### Refined Code:\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract TokenContract {\n    address public owner;\n    uint256 public maxWalletLimit;\n    uint256 public maxTransactionLimit;\n\n    modifier onlyOwner() {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Ownable: caller is not the owner\");\n        _;\n    }\n\n    constructor() {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    function removeLimits() public onlyOwner {\n        // Reset the maximum wallet and transaction limits\n        maxWalletLimit = 0x06765c793fa10079d0000000; // Example large value\n        maxTransactionLimit = 0x06765c793fa10079d0000000; // Example large value\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Refinements:\n1. **Error Handling:** The `require` statement already ensures that only the owner can call the function, so the additional variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`, `var_d`) related to error handling were redundant and removed for simplicity.\n2. **Meaningful Names:** Renamed variables to more descriptive names to improve code readability and maintainability.\n3. **Modifiers:** Introduced an `onlyOwner` modifier to encapsulate the ownership check, making the code cleaner and reusable.\n4. **Constructor:** Added a constructor to initialize the `owner` variable to the contract deployer.\n5. **General Cleanup:** Removed unnecessary variables and simplified the function to focus on its core purpose.",
