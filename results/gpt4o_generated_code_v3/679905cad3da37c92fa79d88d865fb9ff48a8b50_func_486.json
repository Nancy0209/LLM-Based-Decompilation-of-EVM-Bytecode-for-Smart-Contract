However, the decompiled code contains unnecessary complexity and obfuscation, which needs to be simplified and refined.\n\n### Rename Plan:\n- `owner` -> `contractOwner`\n- `var_a` -> `errorSelector`\n- `var_b` -> `errorOffset`\n- `var_c` -> `errorDataLength`\n- `var_d` -> `errorMessageLength`\n- `var_e` -> `errorMessage`\n- `msg.sender` -> `caller`\n\n### Refined Code:\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract Ownable {\n    address private contractOwner;\n\n    event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner);\n\n    modifier onlyOwner() {\n        require(msg.sender == contractOwner, \"Ownable: caller is not the owner\");\n        _;\n    }\n\n    constructor() {\n        contractOwner = msg.sender;\n        emit OwnershipTransferred(address(0), contractOwner);\n    }\n\n    function renounceOwnership() public onlyOwner {\n        emit OwnershipTransferred(contractOwner, address(0));\n        contractOwner = address(0);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Refinement:\n1. **Simplification:** Removed unnecessary variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, etc.) and replaced them with direct logic. The decompiled code had redundant calculations and obfuscated logic that served no purpose.\n2. **Meaningful Names:** Renamed variables to meaningful names (`contractOwner`, `caller`, etc.) for clarity.\n3. **Standardization:** Used the standard `renounceOwnership` implementation pattern commonly found in Solidity contracts.\n4. **Error Handling:** Simplified the error message logic using `require` with a clear error message.\n5. **Event Emission:** Ensured the `OwnershipTransferred` event is emitted correctly when ownership is renounced.",
