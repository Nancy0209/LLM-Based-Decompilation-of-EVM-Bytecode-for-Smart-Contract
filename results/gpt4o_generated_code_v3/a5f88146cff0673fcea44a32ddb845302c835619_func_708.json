It also includes ownership checks to ensure only the contract owner can execute the function.\n\n### Rename Plan:\n- `arg0` -> `newMaxWalletAmount`\n- `var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`, `var_d`, `var_e`, `var_f` -> Remove (unused variables)\n- `totalSupply` -> `totalSupply` (no change, already meaningful)\n- `0x05`, `0x03e8` -> Remove (nonsensical logic)\n\n### Refined Code:\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract ExampleContract {\n    address public owner;\n    uint256 public totalSupply;\n    uint256 public maxWalletAmount;\n\n    modifier onlyOwner() {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Ownable: caller is not the owner\");\n        _;\n    }\n\n    constructor(uint256 _totalSupply) {\n        owner = msg.sender;\n        totalSupply = _totalSupply;\n        maxWalletAmount = (totalSupply * 5) / 100; // Default to 5% of total supply\n    }\n\n    function updateMaxWalletAmount(uint256 newMaxWalletAmount) public onlyOwner {\n        require(newMaxWalletAmount > 0, \"Max wallet amount must be greater than zero\");\n        maxWalletAmount = newMaxWalletAmount;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Refinements:\n1. **Ownership Check:** The `require` statement for ownership was simplified using a `modifier` called `onlyOwner`.\n2. **Meaningful Naming:** Renamed `arg0` to `newMaxWalletAmount` for clarity.\n3. **Removed Unused Variables:** Eliminated `var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`, `var_d`, `var_e`, and `var_f` as they were unused and nonsensical.\n4. **Simplified Logic:** Removed nonsensical checks like `(totalSupply == ((totalSupply * 0x05) / 0x05)) | !0x05` and `require(0x03e8)`.\n5. **Added Constructor:** Included a constructor to initialize `totalSupply` and set a default `maxWalletAmount` as 5% of the total supply.\n6. **Improved Functionality:** Added a check to ensure the new maximum wallet amount is greater than zero.\n\nThis refined code is clean, functional, and adheres to Solidity best practices.",
