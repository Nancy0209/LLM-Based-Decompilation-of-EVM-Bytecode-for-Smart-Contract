It also enforces that only the contract owner can call this function.\n\n### Rename Plan:\n- `arg0` -> `swapTokensAtAmount`\n- `var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`, `var_d`, `var_e`, `var_f`, `var_g` -> Removed (these are artifacts of the decompilation process and are not needed in the refined code).\n- `totalSupply` -> `totalSupply` (unchanged, as it is likely a standard ERC20 variable).\n\n### Refined Code:\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract TokenContract {\n    address public owner;\n    uint256 public totalSupply;\n    uint256 public swapTokensAtAmount;\n\n    modifier onlyOwner() {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Ownable: caller is not the owner\");\n        _;\n    }\n\n    function setSwapTokensAtAmount(uint256 _swapTokensAtAmount) public onlyOwner {\n        // Ensure the swap amount is not lower than 0.001% of the total supply\n        require(\n            _swapTokensAtAmount >= (totalSupply * 1) / 100000,\n            \"Swap amount cannot be lower than 0.001% of total supply.\"\n        );\n\n        // Set the new swap amount\n        swapTokensAtAmount = _swapTokensAtAmount;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Refinements:\n1. **Removed unnecessary variables:** The decompiled code included intermediate variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, etc.) that were artifacts of the decompilation process.
