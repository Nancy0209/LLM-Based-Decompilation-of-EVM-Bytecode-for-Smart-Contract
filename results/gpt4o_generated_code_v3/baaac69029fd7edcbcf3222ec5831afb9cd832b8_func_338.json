However, the code contains redundant checks and variables that can be simplified for clarity and efficiency.\n\n### Rename Plan:\n- `arg0` -> `account` (to represent the address whose balance is being queried)\n- `var_a` -> Removed (redundant variable)\n- `var_b` -> Removed (unused variable)\n- `var_c` -> Removed (redundant variable)\n- `storage_map_b` -> `balances` (likely a mapping of addresses to their balances)\n\n### Refined Code:\n```solidity\nfunction balanceOf(address account) public view returns (uint256) {\n    require(account != address(0), \"Invalid address\");\n    return balances[account];\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Refinements:\n1. **Simplified Logic:** Removed unnecessary variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`) and redundant checks (e.g., `arg0 == address(arg0)`).\n2. **Meaningful Names:** Renamed `arg0` to `account` for clarity and `storage_map_b` to `balances` to better reflect its purpose.\n3. **Added Validation:** Included a check to ensure the address is not the zero address (`address(0)`), which is a common best practice in Solidity.\n4. **Optimized Code:** Directly returned the balance from the mapping without intermediate steps.",
