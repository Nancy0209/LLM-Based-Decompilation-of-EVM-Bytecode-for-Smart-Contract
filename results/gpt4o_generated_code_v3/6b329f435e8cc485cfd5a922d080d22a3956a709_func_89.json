Removed the redundant `require` statement (`require(arg0 == (address(arg0)));`) since it serves no purpose. The `address(arg0)` conversion is unnecessary because `arg0` is already an address.\n2. Eliminated unused variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`) to simplify the code.\n3. Renamed `storage_map_b` to `balances` for clarity, as it likely represents a mapping of addresses to balances.\n4. Simplified the function to directly return the balance from the `balances` mapping for the given `account`.",
