It also emits an event to log the update.\n\n### Rename Plan:\n- `arg0` -> `newDevWallet` (to represent the new developer wallet address being set)\n- `var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`, `var_d` -> Removed (these variables are unnecessary in the refined code)\n- `store_l` -> `devWallet` (to represent the storage variable holding the developer wallet address)\n\n### Refined Code:\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract ExampleContract {\n    address public owner;\n    address public devWallet;\n\n    event DevWalletUpdated(address indexed previousDevWallet, address indexed newDevWallet);\n\n    modifier onlyOwner() {\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \"Ownable: caller is not the owner\");\n        _;\n    }\n\n    constructor() {\n        owner = msg.sender; // Set the contract deployer as the initial owner\n    }\n\n    function updateDevWallet(address newDevWallet) public onlyOwner {\n        require(newDevWallet != address(0), \"Invalid address: newDevWallet cannot be the zero address\");\n        \n        emit DevWalletUpdated(devWallet, newDevWallet); // Emit event with old and new dev wallet addresses\n        devWallet = newDevWallet; // Update the developer wallet address\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Refinements:\n1. **Improved Readability:** The function and variable names were updated to be more descriptive and meaningful.\n2. **Removed Redundant Code:** The unnecessary variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`, `var_d`) were removed as they served no purpose in the decompiled code.\n3. **Added Safety Check:** A check was added to ensure the new developer wallet address is not the zero address.\n4. **Event Logging:** The `DevWalletUpdated` event was refined to include both the previous and new developer wallet addresses for better traceability.\n5. **Access Control:** The `onlyOwner` modifier was introduced to simplify and centralize the ownership check logic.",
