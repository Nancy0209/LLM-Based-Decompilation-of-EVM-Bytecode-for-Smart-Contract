Removed the unnecessary `require` statement (`require(arg0 == (address(arg0)));`) since it serves no purpose. The `account` parameter is already an `address` type.\n2. Eliminated redundant variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`) that added no value to the function.\n3. Renamed `storage_map_b` to `balances` for clarity, assuming it is a mapping of addresses to balances.\n4. Simplified the function to directly return the balance from the `balances` mapping.",
