However, the decompiled code is highly redundant and contains unreachable code, suggesting it needs significant refinement.\n\n### Rename Plan:\n- `arg0` -> `to` (recipient address)\n- `arg1` -> `amount` (amount of tokens to transfer)\n- `var_a` -> `sender` (the address initiating the transfer)\n- `var_b` -> (unused, remove)\n- `var_c` -> (unused, remove)\n- `storage_map_c` -> `balances` (mapping of addresses to their token balances)\n\n### Refined Code:\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract Token {\n    mapping(address => uint256) private balances;\n\n    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);\n\n    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public returns (bool) {\n        address sender = msg.sender;\n\n        // Ensure the sender has enough balance\n        require(balances[sender] >= amount, \"Insufficient balance\");\n\n        // Ensure the transfer amount is greater than zero\n        require(amount > 0, \"Transfer amount must be greater than zero\");\n\n        // Perform the transfer\n        balances[sender] -= amount;\n        balances[to] += amount;\n\n        // Emit the Transfer event\n        emit Transfer(sender, to, amount);\n\n        return true;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Refinements:\n1. **Removed Redundancy:** The original code had repeated checks and unreachable code. These were removed to streamline the function.\n2. **Added `require` Statements:** Added `require` statements to ensure the sender has enough balance and the transfer amount is valid.\n3. **Renamed Variables:** Replaced generic names with meaningful ones for better readability.\n4. **Simplified Logic:** Removed unnecessary variables and operations, focusing on the core transfer logic.\n5. **Event Emission:** Retained the `Transfer` event to log the transfer operation, which is standard in token contracts.",
