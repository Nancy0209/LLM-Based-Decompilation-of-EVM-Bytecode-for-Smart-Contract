The redundant operations and unclear naming suggest it was decompiled and needs refinement.\n\n### Rename Plan:\n- `arg0` -> `account` (to represent the address being checked)\n- `var_a` -> `account` (redundant reassignment, can be removed)\n- `var_b` -> (unused, can be removed)\n- `var_c` -> (redundant, can be removed)\n- `storage_map_n` -> `excludedFromFees` (likely a mapping that tracks fee exclusions)\n\n### Refined Code:\n```solidity\nfunction isExcludedFromFees(address account) public view returns (bool) {\n    require(account != address(0), \"Invalid address\");\n    return excludedFromFees[account];\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Refinements:\n1. **Simplified Logic:** Removed unnecessary reassignments and redundant operations. The decompiled code had unnecessary steps like `var_a` and `var_c` which were not needed.\n2. **Meaningful Names:** Renamed `arg0` to `account` for clarity and `storage_map_n` to `excludedFromFees` to reflect its likely purpose.\n3. **Validation:** Added a check to ensure the input address is not the zero address (`address(0)`), which is a common best practice.\n4. **Readability:** Simplified the return statement to directly return the value from the mapping.\n\nThis refined code is cleaner, more readable, and adheres to Solidity best practices.",
