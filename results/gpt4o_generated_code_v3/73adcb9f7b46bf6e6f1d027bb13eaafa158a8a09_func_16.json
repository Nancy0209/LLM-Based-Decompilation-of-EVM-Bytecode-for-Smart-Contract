However, the decompiled code contains unnecessary complexity and obfuscation, which needs to be simplified and refined.\n\n### Rename Plan:\n- `owner` -> `contractOwner`\n- `var_a` -> `errorSelector`\n- `var_b` -> `errorOffset`\n- `var_c` -> `errorDataOffset`\n- `var_d` -> `errorDataLength`\n- `var_e` -> `errorMessage`\n\n### Refined Code:\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract Ownable {\n    address private contractOwner;\n\n    event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner);\n\n    modifier onlyOwner() {\n        require(msg.sender == contractOwner, \"Ownable: caller is not the owner\");\n        _;\n    }\n\n    constructor() {\n        contractOwner = msg.sender;\n        emit OwnershipTransferred(address(0), contractOwner);\n    }\n\n    function renounceOwnership() public onlyOwner {\n        emit OwnershipTransferred(contractOwner, address(0));\n        contractOwner = address(0);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Refinements:\n1. **Simplified Logic:** Removed unnecessary variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, etc.) and replaced them with direct, readable logic.\n2. **Meaningful Names:** Renamed `owner` to `contractOwner` for clarity and consistency with common Solidity conventions.\n3. **Error Handling:** Used a standard `require` statement with a clear error message for ownership validation.\n4. **Event Emission:** Used the `OwnershipTransferred` event to log the change in ownership.\n5. **Modern Solidity Practices:** Updated the code to use Solidity 0.8.x features, such as built-in overflow checks and improved readability.",
