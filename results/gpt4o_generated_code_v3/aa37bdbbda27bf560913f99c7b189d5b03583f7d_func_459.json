They were removed for clarity.\n2. **Meaningful Names:** The parameter `arg0` was renamed to `account`, and the storage mapping `storage_map_b` was renamed to `balances` to better reflect their purposes.\n3. **Address Validation:** Added a check to ensure the `account` is not the zero address (`address(0)`), which is a common best practice in Solidity.\n4. **Simplified Logic:** The function directly returns the balance from the `balances` mapping, eliminating redundant assignments and operations.",
