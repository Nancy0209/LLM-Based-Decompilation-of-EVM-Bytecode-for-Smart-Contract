This is a common pattern in ERC-165, which is used to declare and check interface support in Ethereum smart contracts.\n\n### Rename Plan:\n- `arg0` -> `interfaceId` (to reflect that this is the identifier of the interface being checked)\n- `var_a` -> (remove, as it is redundant and unused)\n\n### Refined Code:\n```solidity\nfunction supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public pure returns (bool) {\n    // ERC-165 identifier for the ERC-165 standard itself\n    if (interfaceId == 0x01ffc9a7) {\n        return true;\n    }\n    // ERC-165 identifier for ERC-721 (Non-Fungible Token Standard)\n    if (interfaceId == 0x80ac58cd) {\n        return true;\n    }\n    // ERC-165 identifier for ERC-721 Metadata extension\n    if (interfaceId == 0x5b5e139f) {\n        return true;\n    }\n    // ERC-165 identifier for ERC-721 Enumerable extension\n    if (interfaceId == 0x780e9d63) {\n        return true;\n    }\n    // If none of the above, the interface is not supported\n    return false;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Refinements:\n1. **Simplified Logic:** The original code had redundant and overly complex checks, including unnecessary `require` statements and redundant variable assignments. These were removed for clarity and efficiency.\n2. **Meaningful Names:** The parameter `arg0` was renamed to `interfaceId` to reflect its purpose.
