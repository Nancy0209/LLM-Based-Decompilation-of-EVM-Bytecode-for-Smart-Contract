The function returns `true` if the address is flagged as a bot and `false` otherwise.\n\n### Rename Plan:\n- `arg0` -> `userAddress` (the address being checked)\n- `var_a` -> `normalizedAddress` (a redundant variable for the input address)\n- `var_b` -> (remove, as it is unused and irrelevant)\n- `var_c` -> (remove, as it is redundant and unused)\n- `storage_map_b` -> `botFlags` (a mapping that stores bot status for addresses)\n\n### Refined Code:\n```solidity\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract BotChecker {\n    // Mapping to store bot flags for addresses\n    mapping(address => uint8) private botFlags;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Checks if the given address is flagged as a bot.\n     * @param userAddress The address to check.\n     * @return True if the address is flagged as a bot, false otherwise.\n     */\n    function isBot(address userAddress) public view returns (bool) {\n        require(userAddress == address(userAddress), \"Invalid address\");\n        return botFlags[userAddress] != 0;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Refinements:\n1. **Simplified Logic:** Removed redundant variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`) and directly used the input address (`userAddress`) for the mapping lookup.\n2. **Meaningful Names:** Renamed variables and the storage mapping to reflect their purpose clearly.\n3. **Improved Readability:** Simplified the return statement to directly check if the value in the mapping is non-zero, which is equivalent to the original logic.\n4. **Modern Solidity Practices:** Added a `pragma` directive for Solidity versioning and included a comment to explain the purpose of the mapping.",
