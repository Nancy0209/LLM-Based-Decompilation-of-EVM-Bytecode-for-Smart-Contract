These were removed for clarity.\n2. **Added `onlyOwner` modifier:** To simplify the ownership check, a modifier was introduced to ensure the caller is the contract owner.\n3. **Improved readability:** Renamed variables and mappings to meaningful names (`targetAddress`, `contractOwner`, `blacklist`) for better understanding.\n4. **Added constructor:** The constructor initializes the contract owner to the deployer of the contract.\n5. **Added validation for `targetAddress`:** Ensures the address being unblacklisted is not the zero address, which is a common best practice.",
