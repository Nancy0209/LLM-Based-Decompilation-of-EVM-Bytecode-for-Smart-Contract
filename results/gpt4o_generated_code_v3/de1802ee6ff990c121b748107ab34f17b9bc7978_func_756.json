Removed unnecessary variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`) that added no value to the logic.\n2. Simplified the logic to directly return the value from the `excludedFromFee` mapping.\n3. Renamed `arg0` to `account` for clarity.\n4. Assumed `storage_map_a` is a mapping named `excludedFromFee` based on the function's purpose.\n5. Removed redundant checks and operations, such as `require(arg0 == (address(arg0)))` and double negations, as they serve no purpose in this context.",
