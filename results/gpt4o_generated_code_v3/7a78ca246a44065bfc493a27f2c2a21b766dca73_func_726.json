However, the code contains redundant checks and unclear variable names that need refinement.\n\n### Rename Plan:\n- `arg0` -> `account` (to clarify that this is the address whose balance is being queried)\n- `var_a` -> `queriedAddress` (to make it clear this is the address being processed)\n- `var_b` -> (remove, as it serves no purpose in the code)\n- `var_c` -> (remove, as it is redundant and unused)\n- `storage_map_b` -> `balances` (to indicate this is a mapping of account balances)\n\n### Refined Code:\n```solidity\nfunction balanceOf(address account) public view returns (uint256) {\n    require(account != address(0), \"Invalid address\");\n    return balances[account];\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Refinements:\n1. **Simplified Logic:** Removed unnecessary variables (`var_a`, `var_b`, `var_c`) and redundant checks (`require(arg0 == address(arg0))`).\n2. **Meaningful Names:** Renamed `arg0` to `account` and `storage_map_b` to `balances` for clarity.\n3. **Improved Validation:** Added a check to ensure the address is not the zero address (`address(0)`), which is a common best practice in Solidity.\n4. **Concise Code:** Streamlined the function to directly return the balance from the `balances` mapping.",
